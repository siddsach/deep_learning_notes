# deep_learning_notes

I keep coming across so many amazing resources, BUT I often forget about them or want to share them with others, so I thought I'd start collecting a list of them, along with a sentence-long description of what they do. Open an issue if something interests you but you don't understand it! I'll try and put a better explanation to help.
