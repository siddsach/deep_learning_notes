# deep_learning_notes

I keep coming across so many amazing papers, BUT I often forget about them or want to share them with others, so I thought I'd start collecting a list of them, along with a sentence-long description of what they do. Open an issue if something interests you but you don't understand it! I'll try and put a better explanation to help.


## NLP Papers
* [Using discourse markers like "but" and "and" as signals for learning high-quality sentence representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.04334.pdf)
* [Unsupervised translation words between languages using word embedding embedding spaces](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.04087.pdf)
* 

## Implementations
* [Wavenet Speech synthesis in Pytorch](https://github.com/dhpollack/fast-wavenet.pytorch)
*
